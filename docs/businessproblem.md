# An unhappy customer

Eddie is an existing Green Telco Inc customer living in Orlando Fl.  He has been using the services provided by the Green Telco for the last 2 years. Currently, he is not under any contract.  Eddie signed for a new phone which was "buy one get one" free bundle. He bought one of the phone with cash and he put the other phone on a monthly plan. For Eddie to get the second phone free he has to submit the receipt to the Green Telco to get an equivalent value of the phone as a credit card. Eddie was traveling to conferences in Madrid and in Bangkok so he also signed up for international text and data service.  

So he owns two phones:  

* Sam Milky Way Phone 1   $750   paid in full with cash
* Sam Milky Way Phone 2   $750   on a monthly plan of $30

Upon submission of receipt the Green Telco company sends a Credit Card of $750. Eddie can use the Credit card to pay the balance of $750 for phone 2. Further, Eddie signed for free international text and data for a fee of $10 a month when he is traveling overseas to Madrid and, Bangkok.

After Eddie submitted the receipt to the Green Telco provider, Eddie went to Madrid and then to Bangkok.

While in Bangkok the data plan and the text plan was very slow and did not perform to the level that the sales person at the Green Telco had suggested Eddie that it will work.  By paying $10 per month extra Eddie was told that he will get double the speed. In reality the original speed was very less and even after double the speed, the speed was very less. So, Eddie was not very happy with the service. Eddie, felt that the sales person did not reveal all the information.

To add insult to injury when Eddie came back to check on his status for the free phone (he had not received any notification from the Green Telco). So, Eddie contacts the Telecom provider support via a chat bot on the web application.

The telecom provider informs Eddie that his claim was rejected and that he does not qualify for the $750 phone.

Eddie, who was already not happy with the International Data and Text service he had signed-up for and now he was not getting his refund.

The chat bot then checks the customer churn scoring service and finds out that the customer churn predicts a churn with a very high level of confidence and immediately notifies Eddie that a supervisor will contact Eddie to resolve the issue.

The supervisor contacts Eddie immediately. He apologizes to Eddie that the speed to begin with is very low and even by adding $10 the double speed does not make much of a difference. This service is mostly designed for texting and browsing emails and some important work and not designed for the kind of quality of service that Eddie is used to in the US.

Further the supervisor explains to Eddie that the reason he was not given the $750 is because both the phones have to be on contract payment. Since one of the phone was a cash payment the promotion does not apply. The supervisor acknowledged that to fix the problem, she had called the store and if Eddie goes to the store the previous transaction will be reversed and both the phone would be put on contract and his $750 payment will be expedited.

Eddie walks in the store and his problem was resolved. Once, he got the refund in one week he paid the first phone with his cash and the second phone with the $750 visa card.

The customer churn service helped Eddie to remain as a customer for the Green Telco.
